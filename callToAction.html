    <p>
        Here is the last graph from the interractive dashboard. It shows that over 50% of the concussions are caused by one helmet hitting another helmet. There are also lots of concussions caused by other contacts. Since there are plenty of rules that have been implemented in the NFL to prevent helmet to helmet contact, I would like to see an improvement in the helmet technology. This will protect people hitting and being hit as well as when these people hit the ground in any scenario.
