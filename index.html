    <h1> Concussions in Professional Sports Leagues in the United States
    </h1>
    <p>At every level of sports, players get injured. Some injuries are much more severe than others. One injury that is common among almost all sports is concussions. No matter how big of a helmet a player puts on, there is still a chance of a concussion. Recently, there has been a large number of former players coming forward and sharing their stories about thier struggles with brain damage. A concussion can be seen as an injury that makes a player ineligible to play for a while, but in reality, these injuries have a lasting impact on people's lives. I believe that it is important to see the facts about concussions in order for people to make an informed decision about their lives and their loved ones' lives.
